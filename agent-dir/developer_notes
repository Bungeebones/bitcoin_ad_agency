Feb 20, 2019 Regarding all the "getsubcat" and getsubloc" files (1,2,3,4) they all can be consoldated into probably just two files (maybe one). 
There's just a couple differences in all the getsubcat where there are the numbers (1,2,3 or 4)used in a line of code which
could be replaced with a variable. The lines of code calling them would need to be found and altered to send the value when the page is called.
