An enterprise level platform of the Bitcoin-only ad network designed especially for professionals in the web designers, web hosting, SEO, web advertising, newspapers, magazines, fields. It enables them to offer their customers initially free advertising across an entire ad network of websites and essentially "gift" their own customers with free advertising. 

More importantly, it opens up the potential for a "joint venture" between the customer and the agent to monetize the web traffic and/or the social network of their customer in a win-win arrangement that fosters a higher level of cooperation between the service provider and the customer resulting in higher customer retention and satisfaction. 

Agency level participants must already be registered as users in the Manna Network system in order to activate their script. If you need a Manna Network account you can find one of our agents to register at here: <a target="_blank" href="http://manna-network.cash/agents/agents_list.php">http://manna-network.cash/agents/agents_list.php</a>
