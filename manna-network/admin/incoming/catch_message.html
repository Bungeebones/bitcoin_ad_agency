/*
You can also bind to events regardless of the channel the event is broadcast to. By using the pusher.bind() method rather than channel.bind(), you can listen for an event on all the channels that you are currently subscribed to.
EXAMPLE
var pusher = new Pusher('APP_KEY');
var channel1 = pusher.subscribe('my-channel-1');
var channel2 = pusher.subscribe('my-channel-2');
var channel3 = pusher.subscribe('my-channel-3');

var eventName = 'new-comment';
var callback = function(data) {
    // add comment into page
  };

// listen for 'new-comment' event on channel 1, 2 and 3
pusher.bind(eventName, callback);
