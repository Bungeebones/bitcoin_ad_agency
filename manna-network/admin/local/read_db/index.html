<p>All of the queries on the below pages can used to build all the functions for creating the directory page. <br>Since they are "read only" they will be very secure. <br>Each table has its own separate user and password too.

<br><a href="https://mannanetwork.co/agent/local/read_db/categories_tbl.php">categories</a> 
<br><a href="https://mannanetwork.co/agent/local/read_db/categories_regional2_tbl.php">categories_regional2</a> 
<br><a href="https://mannanetwork.co/agent/local/read_db/links_tbl.php">links</a>
<br><a href="https://mannanetwork.co/agent/local/read_db/price_slots_subscripts_tbl.php">price_slots_subscripts</a>
<br><a href="https://mannanetwork.co/agent/local/read_db/regional_sign_ups_tbl.php">regional_sign_ups</a>

<p>If this version is only going to send the values as json to the clients then just a few filters on the queries and the read part will be done.
